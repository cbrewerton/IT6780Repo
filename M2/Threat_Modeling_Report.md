# **Comprehensive Data Flow Diagram (DFD) and Risk Assessment Report for "The Recipe Hub"**

---

## **Introduction**

Data Flow Diagrams provide a clear and structured visual representation of how data moves through a system by all entities such as users, admins, and third party services. DFDs help identify the interaction points where data is processed, stored, or transmitted. This allows for a better understanding of system architecture, helping to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats.

Risk assessments are a critical part of securing a web application. They help with the identification of vulnerabilities that could lead a myriad of bad scenarios. By understanding these risks, developers and engineers can implement security measures to mitigate threats and ensure all three aspects of the CIA triad remain intact within the system.

## **Data Flow Diagrams for "The Recipe Hub"**

### **Level 0 DFD**

The [Level 0 DFD](./DFD_Level_0.drawio) provides an overall view of how "The Recipe Hub" interacts with external entities. In this case, the main external entity is the user of the application.
As shown in the diagram, the user will interact with the web application in order to register/login, browse, rate, comment and make payments on the application. Adminstrators will moderate, remove, view payment information, and edit pages.

### **Level 1 DFD**

The [Level 1 DFD](./DFD_Level_1.drawio) provides a more detailed explanation of different data flows that are shown in the [DFD Level 0.](./DFD_Level_0.drawio) Each specific "box" in the diagram represents a seperate data-flow that starts with an external entity (in this case, the user), interacts with the web application, and then returns some sort of output. This output is generally sent to the backend of the application (api, databases) which then returns some sort of result (posted recipe or review, for example).

## **Threats and Vulnerabilities Analysis**

Based on the DFDs for "The Recipe Hub," many potential threats were identified that cooresponded to the major data flows. These are outlined in the [Threat Analysis Document.](./Threat_Analysis.md)
A summary of the findings is outlined below.

### **1. User Registration and Authentication**

- **Potential Threats**:
  - Brute force attacks.
  - Abuse of password recovery systems.
  - SQL Injection

- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Weak password policies.
  - Lack of MFA.
  - No input sanitization on login fields.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement strong password requirements.
  - Enforce MFA.
  - Secure password storage using hashing algorithms and salts.
  - Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.
  - Sanitize inputs for login credentials.

---

### **2. Recipe Browsing and Searching**

- **Potential Threats**:
  - SQL Injection via search queries.
  - Data leakage via poorly sanitized inputs.

- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Inadequate input validation.
  - Lack of parameterized queries on search functions.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Sanitize all inputs.
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
  - Secure API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access.

---

### **3. Recipe Submission and Management**

- **Potential Threats**:
  - Malicious file uploads (steganography attacks).
  - Content tampering.

- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Insufficient validation of file types.
  - Missing integrity checks for submitted content.
  - Lack of malware scanning on user imputs before database transactions take place.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Validate file types for all uploads.
  - Implement virus scanning for uploaded content.
  - Use an admin approval process to review submitted recipes.

---

### **4. Rating and Commenting**

- **Potential Threats**:
  - XSS attacks via user comments.
  - Abusive or spam comments.

- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Lack of input filtering.
  - Absence of moderation mechanisms.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Filter user input to prevent XSS.
  - Content moderation (manual or automated)

---

### **5. Payment Processing**

- **Potential Threats**:
  - Payment data interception (MITM).
  - Fraudulent transactions.

- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - Insecure payment gateway integration.
  - Lack of encryption for sensitive data.

- **Mitigation**:
  - Use HTTPS for all transactions.
  - Ensure PCI-DSS.
  - Encrypt all payment-related data both in transit and at rest.
  - Third-Party payment portal.

## **Conclusion**

Data Flow Diagrams are valuable for understanding the structure of a system and identifying critical areas where threats may exist. In "The Recipe Hub," several key processes have been analyzed, with potential risks along the application's potential attack surface. 

By implementing the recommended security measures, the application can possibly mitigate these risks and increase its own security posture in the face of ever growing threats and cyberattacks.
